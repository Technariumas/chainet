Chainet is a type of sneakernet/dropnet where the media stays put, and
participants come over to enjoy a cup of chai.

This script is a minimal "version control system", to administer such
networks, without the version control. It is written in an ubiquitous
scripting language, and in as few lines as possible, to preserve our
precious screenspace and chaitime.
